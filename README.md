## Hello World

I built [*The Orderbook DEX*](https://github.com/TheOrderbookDEX). You can read more about this under the section titled [*The Orderbook DEX*](#the-orderbook-dex).

I wrote some other code that might be useful too, maybe I'll write about it here some day.

## whoami

I'm an all-round developer who might be spending too much time trying to make code look *beautiful*... if a release is delayed, it's probably my fault.

I was lucky to have very good teachers, they didn't teach me to code, they taught me how to think algorithmically and told me to read the docs, and that's what I've been doing since.

Some of them also taught me that you don't write code for the machine, you write code for other developers. That someone else can read and understand your code is as important as the code working as expected.

I prefer using non opinionated libraries and tools whenever possible. The answer to the question "why don't you use X?" is generally this.
